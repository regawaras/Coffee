Coffee Obsidian Theme
By regawaras

Overview
The "Coffee" theme for Obsidian offers a rich visual experience, bringing the duality of coffee flavors through its dark (Dark Coffee) and light (Light Coffee) modes. This theme is designed to provide an ergonomic, soothing, and warm feel to your eyes, creating a comfortable working environment.

Key Features
Two Modes, One Aesthetic: Enjoy a coffee-inspired color palette, optimized for both dark and light modes. The light mode is specifically crafted for visual comfort with warm undertones.

Coffee-Based Color Customization: Utilizes CSS variables named after coffee terms (e.g., --americano, --crema, --hazelnut) for consistency and ease of customization.

Personalized UI Elements: Deep customization for title bars, backgrounds, text, links, tags, scrollbars, and tables to align with the coffee theme.

Intelligent Highlighting: Features active line and hover line highlighting in the source view for easier navigation.

Unique File Explorer Icons: Custom folder (üìÇ) and file (üìù) icons in the Obsidian file explorer.

Enhanced Text Styling: Custom styles for text highlights, cursor caret, and callout blocks.

Professional Print Settings: Includes specific styles for PDF printing, ensuring documents look polished with "Times New Roman" font and justified text.

Dynamic List Display: Adjustments for both bullet points and numbered lists, with animations for collapsed and uncollapsed items.

Themed Horizontal Lines: Unique horizontal rules with an embedded Obsidian logo, adding a personal touch to your notes.

Credits
This theme is a fork and is inspired by two other Obsidian Themes with similar designs. My goal was to make this theme completely easy to use and accessible for everyone. Many thanks to the original theme developers for their inspiration
